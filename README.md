Ren'Py Graph
============

A tool for statically analysing the branching structure of Ren'Py games. Can be
used to easily see which branches exist in the game, and how they affect the
game. Though the current implementation is fairly limited.

> **NOTE:**
>
> This was pretty much written because I was having a hard time figuring out how
> the branching affected variables/CGs for the gallery in Cute Demon Crashers!,
> because of that the current parser and analyser are pretty much limited to
> that use case. If people find this (concept/tool) useful, I might work on
> making it more general and usable.
